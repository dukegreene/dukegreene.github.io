	<h2>I'm Duke.</h2>
	<h3 id="hesitant">Or am I?</h3>
	<h6>(As headings get smaller, I get more insecure.)</h6>
	<p>Plus, what is the entity "Duke," anyway? <br/>
		 Is it the body that types this code? <br/>
		 Is it the brain that tells the body what to type? <br/>
		 Or is it some greater awareness capable of meta-reflection?</p> 
	<p>Heck, is "Duke" even human? Maybe. Maybe not. How would you be able to tell?</p>

	<p>Let's not worry about this stuff anymore. I hear there will be yoga in Chicago. We can make time for deep seraching mindfulness then. <br/>
		 (I hope it's <em>anusara</em> yoga; I'm not sure how I'd hold up in a <em>bikram</em>-type situation.) <br/>
		 For now, I'll wash my <strike>paws</strike> <strong>hands</strong> of all this introspection, and make a list or two.</p>
	<h4>Facts about me:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>I do communications work full time. I'm a singer-songwriter-rapper in my spare time. I'm a dad all the time.</li>
		<li>I'm brand new to programming. This is the first HTML I've written from scratch.</li>
		<li>I like absurdist humor, puns, and meta-jokes.</li>
		<li>Before I started losing my hair, I had these wonderful blond dreadlocks. They were <strong>gorgeous</strong>.</li>
		<li id="hesitant">So gorgeous. Now I'm a little sad.</li> 
	</ol>
