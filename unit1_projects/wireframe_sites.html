<h2>Reddit</h2>

<p>Reddit sets out solve the problem of a huge and chaotic Internet by collecting the most popular user-submitted links and displaying them as requested by each user. Visually, it's difficult to collect different types of links and organize  them without diminishing the type of content in any given link; images are presented the same way as long essays, and the format (thumbnail, short submission comment) doesn't really serve either in an ideal way. With all the organizing Reddit tries to help with, the screen is full of information at all times. Reddit's challenge is to keep this information from looking like clutter, and they do a good job through use of a header, sidebars, and unobtrusive grey links between more colorful main content. The comment sections are indented like nested programming code, which helps the eye scan through long comment pages. The only confusing visual element is that the homepage link is always the image of whatever subreddit you're in. The lack of uniformity is kind of disorienting.</p>

<h2>Craigslist</h2>

<p>Craigslist wants to make it easier for people to sell their stuff online. Their no-frills site design embodies the mission well. The first thing I see when I land is a list of types of things I might need - jobs, consumables, relationships - and each of them is a link, so I can dive in and start browsing right away. With a search bar on every page, I can always narrow my focus. No matter where I travel on CL, it's easy for me to click back to the last category or home page, so I never have to break momentum to make an adjustment in what I'm looking for. The challenge here is to avoid displaying so much information that the user gets overwhelmed. Since the postings are already text-heavy, Craigslist has to make liberal use of its white space to avoid looking like one big wall of type. Ultimately, though, user experience depends on ease and clarity of results, not flashiness of presentation. The chosen visual style perfectly suits the content.</p>

<h2>WordPress</h2>

<p>WordPress lives and dies with the content its users create, so I think their primary goal is to get people blogging. They go out of their way to make it simple, with a large, friendly "New Post" icon at the top of the screen. To keep the site visually interesting, they feature an infinite blog scroll that takes up the majority of the homepage. It's fairly easy to post content, although full posting and editing capabilities are only accessible with two or more clicks. That's something of a hassle, but it's made bearable with the inclusion of a "My Blog" hubpage that links to stats, editable past posts, and settings. Throughout the site, navigation and formatting links are easy to find and read, and usually clustered across the top of the page or to the right. By keeping the middle of the viewable space free from distractions, WordPress makes it easier for the eye to focus on the blog itself while reading or writing. Of the three sites I checked out, this one had the cleanest design overall.</p>
