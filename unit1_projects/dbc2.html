		<p>Hi. I'm a musician named Duke and I'm learning how HTML/CSS works. It's a sloppy process, but I love it so far. While I look forward to gaining a little more mastery, this present state of not-knowing-but-learning is kind of intoxicating.</p>
		<p>If I made this into my blog or homepage, this sidebar would have some info about who I am and what I do. I might put a mission statement of sorts here, or maybe some internal links to other areas of my site. I certainly wouldn't just ramble on about vague plans in the hope of seeming clever and meta. Totally not my style.</p>
		<p>If you have any suggestions about this sidebar, feel free to <a href="mailto:dukegreene@gmail.com?Subject=Suggestions" target="_blank">email me</a> and get them off your chest.

		<p style="margin-top: 0px">So far, so good. It's late night Thursday, and I'm crossing the halfway point of this week's challenges. I'm excited to get to the next few; other boots have started uploading their work and it's a great motivator for me to push myself a little harder. <span>Hopefully</span> I'll be able to finish this and start in on #6 before I doze off.</p>
		<p>If I had to pick one word to describe this Phase 0 work so far, it would be "overwhelming." Not because any given assignment is particularly difficult, but because I have to keep resisting this urge into diving down every single rabbit hole I discover. I think it's a habit I carried over from my days as a salesman, when I would probe endlessly to find the piece of information that would help me gain the trust of my client and proceed with the transaction. Or <span>maybe</span> it's a holdover from my days as a Dark Souls fanatic, when I would scour the lore wiki for clues about the game world and meticulously plan out my character builds. Whatever caused this tendency to overthink and dive too deep, it makes every day a little harder than it has to be, as I struggle to get out of my own head and move on to the next task.</p>
		<p>I'm sure I'll get the hang of it. Someday. Maybe tomorrow.</p>
		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Tomorrow is here. I didn't finish what I started last night. I was too tired to concentrate properly and I ended up touching too much in the html style settings, causing my page to look horrendous. I'm going to save any position changes for the CSS. It's hard for me to do things in the exact order I'm instructed to. It's even harder for me to walk away from an unsolved problem and take a break to eat or sleep. But DBC is right about how breaks pay dividends. I woke up this morning with a clear head and a slightly better understanding about how my site elements are supposed to work. I also realized that I could have saved a ton of time by creating a basic template before starting in with sepcifics. Next time I write a page, I'll do that.</p>
		<p>I am acutely aware that it's Friday and that my family needs time on the weekends. And my lawn is disgustingly long. If I want to have any hope of a sane weekend, I've got to get through this challenge and the next one by the end of the day. Time to be a force of nature...</p>
